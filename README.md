# TicTactToe.py
This program allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe on the command line. The game is played on a 3x3 board, and players take turns entering the column and row where they would like to place their piece (either an "X" or an "O"). The program checks if a player has won after each move, and the game ends if one player has won or if the board is full.
